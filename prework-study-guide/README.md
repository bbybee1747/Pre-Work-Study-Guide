# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project was created as a way to familiarize myself with the coding languages HTML, CSS, and Javascript before i start the coding bootcamp. I am going into this bootcamp with a very limited understand of the coding languages and how they affect building and designing a webpage so this project has been a nice and informartive way for me to learn the languages and see how they work in a real environment. I have discovered that I appreciate the structure of HTML but think that i will enjoy the flexibility of Javescript a lot. I also learned that I have a lot more to learn in order for me to be competitive in this class.

## Usage

This webpage can and is used as a means of taking all of the information that I learned in the prework and putting the most important pieces in one easy to see environment that can be used to look back on information that I might need later on during the bootcamp. Using Devtools we can see the JavaScript running which can be useful to let us know that everything is correct in their functions.
